				<p class="testimonial_a"><a href="/products/why.html" class="a2">“These days it seems like everybody wants wide plank floors. Many still believe in that old German saying, the wider the plank, the bigger the bank. And yet, wide plank floors keep me up at night. They can be an architect’s nightmare... Lamination is the only reliable alternative.”</a></p>

			<p class="p0a"><span class="p0c">Virtu is 100% American, born and bred</span> right here in West Nyack, New York. We are just a 45-minute drive from the most demanding market for fine floors in America, the architects and builders of New York City and Manhattan. These individuals have built global reputations on accepting nothing less than their own incredibly high standards.</p>
			<p class="p2a">We consider the custom made floor the highest level of craftsmanship, even though under foot. A custom floor must serve its master hand and foot, night and day, year after year. As a result, Virtu considers those who specify and those who create fine wood floors to be valued members of the Virtu community. It is on their behalf that we spend every day in the pursuit of making the finest floors made in America.</p> 
			<p class="p2b">And because each of our products is made entirely by American workers who earn a living wage and enjoy liberal benefits, we are able to support the concept of American quality every single payday of the year. We like to say that nothing is imported but the coffee we drink. Virtu products contain no plywood—from Asia, Europe or the USA. Even the glue used in constructing every square inch of Virtu Wide Plank Flooring is made in the USA.</p>
			<p class="p2b">Our owners come from a family that has served the high quality demand of the flooring industry in the Northeast for more than 60 years. But we won’t stop there. If there is a demand for the finest wide plank floor anywhere in America, Virtu wants to be the first call made to fill it. That means we have to deliver for our people, over and over again. Good can never be good enough for those who expect the best from Virtu.</p>
			<p class="p2c">Virtu is a custom manufactured product made entirely in America, so our availability for most items can be measured in weeks, not months. That puts us just a phone call away from each and every customer. We are easy to reach, easy to speak to, and always ready to help. Another way we work to live up to our name every day.</p>
