			<p class="p0a">“I have seen millions of dollars in the highest quality wide plank wood flooring reduced to kindling by the unwanted presence or absence of airborne moisture. Moisture related movement is the undoing of the wide plank wood floor, and it sets limits on the creativity of the designer and architect.
			We flooring contractors have gone through absurd lengths in an attempt to meet the design criteria for wide widths. All of our efforts are to maintain stability and minimize shrinkage, but it is expensive and risky to try to fool Mother Nature.</p>
			<p class="p2b">“Virtu Wide Plank Flooring uses wood’s natural characteristics to improve stability and minimize shrinkage, without any extra effort on the flooring contractor’s part. To have a floor of this quality made in this country, with availability measured in days and weeks instead of months – this is a huge step forward."</p>

			<p class="p1a">"These days it seems like everybody wants wide plank floors – many still believe in that old German saying, the wider the plank, the bigger the bank. And yet, wide plank floors keep me up at night. They can be an architect’s nightmare. Solid wood can only be milled so wide before stability and longevity become significant issues. Lamination is the only reliable alternative.</p>
			<p class="p2b">“With Virtu Wide Plank Floors, Dan Reisen seems to have addressed the stability and movement issues decisively. The true balanced construction used in Virtu certainly is at the leading edge of the wood science's battle against the destabilizing forces of moisture content in wood. And besides, once these floors are installed, no one is the wiser that this is anything but a solid wood plank floor."</p>

			<p class="p1a">“I have some of the most demanding clients in New York. What they want, I make happen. And they often want wide plank wood floors. Engineered wide plank floors run the gamut from the ridiculous to the sublime when it comes to quality, price and value. Some European companies provide quality products, but trying to get them to be responsive during design development can be highly frustrating; they just do not understand or operate at our pace. God help the job that runs short 300 sq. ft., and completion hangs on dealing with a company in Europe for pricing and delivery.</p>
			<p class="p2b">I have had the experience of trying to get a pack of flooring through U.S. customs at JFK Airport on a Friday. The paperwork was incomplete, the material was held up and we missed our deadline. Dan Reisen makes his 'Virtu wide' thirty minutes from New York City. What a relief to have a service oriented U.S. manufacturer producing wide plank engineered flooring at this level of quality.”</p>

			<p class="p1a">“In my business, time is money. And that means I get to turn the worst choice into somebody’s first choice with every decision I make. So if I have a brownstone in the East 60’s to bring back to its original grandeur, right down to the gaslight sconces and the plank floor on the parlor level, I better get it right the first time.</p>
			<p class="p2b">“One of the big problems we face in restoration jobs is having to deal with pre-existing conditions. You never know what you will find in walls or under the floors. That’s why I can’t wait to use Virtu Flooring. True Balanced Construction is the real deal—a floor without compromises—flexible in specifying and tolerant of a wide range of conditions. A top quality, long length wide plank floor that can be laid directly on concrete! Virtu Flooring will make my life easier, and I can’t say that about many other products today.”</p>
