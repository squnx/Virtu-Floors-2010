					<p>From the moment we began producing our first commercial grade flooring in July of 2011, Virtu has earned the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification for Chain of Custody processing.
					We understand clearly that the decisions and practices we engage in today will have a profound impact on the overall health and quality of tomorrow's timberlands.</p>
					<p>Many Virtu flooring products will proudly wear the FSC certification label as your assurance that Virtu Wide Plank Flooring meets some of the most stringent environmental guidelines in the industry.
					Virtu is committed to ensuring that the quantity and quality of our nation’s wood resources will improve over time, which is why Virtu vigorously promotes responsible efforts to achieve the fastest practical application of environmentally conscious permanent forest management initiatives.</p>

					<h3>Here’s what the experts have to say about Virtu</h3>
					<p class="p" style="padding:16px 0 0 0">“I have seen millions of dollars in the highest quality wide plank wood flooring reduced to kindling by the unwanted presence or absence of airborne moisture. Moisture related movement is the undoing of the wide plank wood floor, and it sets limits on the creativity of the designer and architect.
					We flooring contractors have gone through absurd lengths in an attempt to meet the design criteria for wide widths.
					All of our efforts are to maintain stability and minimize shrinkage, but it is expensive and risky to try to fool Mother Nature.</p>
					<p>Virtu Wide Plank Flooring uses wood’s natural characteristics to improve stability and minimize shrinkage, without any extra effort on the flooring contractor’s part. To have a floor of this quality made in this country, with availability measured in days and weeks instead of months &ndash; this is a huge step forward.”</p>
					<p style="padding:8px 0 16px 0"><strong>Janos Spitzer, Wood Flooring Installer, Consultant<br>Janos P. Spitzer Flooring Co., Inc.</strong></p>
					<p class="p" style="padding:16px 0 0 0">“These days it seems like everybody wants wide plank floors. Many still believe in that old German saying, the wider the plank, the bigger the bank. And yet, wide plank floors keep me up at night—they can be an architect’s nightmare.
					Solid wood can only be milled so wide before stability and longevity become significant issues. Lamination is the only reliable alternative.</p>
					<p>With Virtu Wide Plank Flooring, Dan Reisen seems to have addressed the stability and movement issues decisively. The true balanced construction used in Virtu certainly is at the leading edge of the wood science's battle against the destabilizing forces of moisture content in wood.
					And besides, once these floors are installed, no one is the wiser that this is anything but a solid wood plank floor.”</p>
					<p style="padding:8px 0 16px 0"><strong>Thomas Kligerman, Principal<br>Ike Kligerman Barkley Architects P.C.</strong></p>
					<p class="p" style="padding:16px 0 0 0">“I was like everybody else in this business. Engineered wide plank floors run the gamut from the ridiculous to the sublime when it comes to quality, price and value. European goods like Mafi, Schotten & Hansen and DiLegno held strong at the top of the tree. But God help the job that runs short 300 sq. ft., and hangs on dealing with some guy in Genk, Belguim or Peiting, Germany for price and timing.</p>
					<p>I have had the experience of trying to get a pack of flooring through U.S. customs at JFK Airport on a Friday night. You just pray that the paperwork is in order, but you know deep down inside even that may not help. Dan Reisen makes his Virtu wide plank three hours from here. And I’ll tell you the truth. Guys that have been in this business for 25 years or more can’t tell the difference between Virtu and Mafi, until they see the waybill.”</p>

					<p class="p" style="padding:16px 0 0 0">“In my business, time is money. And that means I get to turn the worst choice into somebody’s first choice with every decision I make. So if I have a brownstone in the East 60’s to bring back to its original grandeur, right down to the gaslight sconces and the plank floor on the parlor level, I better get it right the first time.</p>
					<p>“One of the big problems we face in restoration jobs is having to deal with pre-existing conditions. You never know what you will find in walls or under the floors. That’s why I can’t wait to use Virtu Flooring. True Balanced Construction is the real deal–a floor without compromises–flexible in specifying and tolerant of a wide range of conditions. A top quality, long length wide plank floor that can be laid directly on concrete!
					Virtu Flooring will make my life easier, and I can’t say that about many other products today.”</p>
					<p style="padding:8px 0 16px 0"><strong>Martin Pine, Project Manager<br>Gryphon Construction</strong></p>
					<p class="p" style="padding:16px 0 0 0">"The option to use a wide plank, long length floor on radiant heat was too risky, because the constant heat forces moisture from the wood and creates gapping between the boards. But now there is Virtu. True Balanced Construction allows Virtu to move less and distort less while providing the beauty and richness of a wide plank floor."</p>

					<h2>5 things every architect should know about Virtu:</h2>
					<p class="asideP" style="padding:16px 0 0 0"><span class="asideF">ONE.</span> Virtu reduces gapping. 3-Layer, True Balanced Construction makes Virtu shrink 67% less than solid wood wide plank.</p>
					<p>Studies performed at Virginia Tech and at the Virtu Labs indicate that the movement of a Virtu plank is only about one third of the movement of a solid wood floor plank of comparable species and width, which produces a dramatic reduction in gapping in the dry season.</p>
					<p style="padding:8px 0 16px 0">A 7" face Virtu floor will move about the same amount as a 2-1/4" solid wood floor of the same type without any special treatment. This means you can install Virtu as you would a solid wood floor, without the need to screw and plug.</p>
					
					<p class="asideP" style="padding:16px 0 0 0"><span class="asideF">TWO.</span> Virtu remains flat. 3-Layer, True Balanced Construction makes Virtu far more stable than solid wood wide plank.</p>
					<p>Virtu uses nature’s own forces to do the work of maintaining stability instead of applying man made forces to fight against wood’s natural physical properties. Both time and experience have proven that a balanced face and back that sandwiches a thicker, crossbanded core is the most stable flooring construction available.</p>
					<p style="padding:8px 0 16px 0">With Virtu, the face and back are the same thickness, species and grain alignment, whether quartersawn or flatsawn. The Virtu core, with its grain running perpendicular to the face and back, retards shrinkage on the face, assuring the stiffness required to keep the floorboard flat as the other lamellas move, thereby maximizing stability.</p>
					
					<p class="asideP" style="padding:16px 0 0 0"><span class="asideF">THREE.</span> Virtu is more versatile. Virtu allows you to go safely where other floors fear to tread.</p>
					<p>The natural stability of Virtu allows it to be utilized in the most difficult conditions. Confidently specify Virtu for:
						<ul class="li">
						<li>Wider planks over radiant heat</li>
						<li>Kitchens and bathrooms</li>
						<li>Coastal locations</li>
						<li>Below-grade conditions</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p style="padding:8px 0 16px 0">The enhanced stability and reduced movement of a Virtu floor provides you with the freedom to design far beyond yesterday’s concerns and constraints.</p>
					
					<p class="asideP" style="padding:16px 0 0 0"><span class="asideF">FOUR.</span> Virtu leads in LEED points. Virtu can help you gain LEED points on your next project, whether residential or commercial. This is what you should know to qualify:</p>
					<p>
						<ul class="li">
						<li>LEED Residential<br><br>MR-2: For FSC certified products that are extracted, processed and manufactured within 500 miles of the building location – 1/2 point for each</li><br>
						<li>LEED Commercial<br><br>
							MR-2: For FSC certified products that are extracted, processed and manufactured within 500 miles of the building location – 1/2 point for each<br><br>
							EQ 4.1: Low emitting adhesives – (contributing)<br><br>
							EQ 4.2 Low emitting finish (if selected) – 1 point<br><br>
							EQ 4.4: No urea formaldehyde used in the manufacture of engineered flooring – 1 point<br><br>
							MR 5.1: Material extracted and manufactured within 500 mile of the installation (if applicable) – 1 point<br><br>
							MR 5.2: Value of regional materials is at least 20% of the total material value – (contributing)<br><br>
							MR 7: FSC certified material (when specified) – 1 point
						</li><br>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="asideP" style="padding:16px 0 0 0"><span class="asideF">FIVE.</span> Virtu provides longevity. Virtu wide plank provides low lifecycle cost.</p>
					<p>Virtu flooring promises the same life—possibly a longer life—than conventional solid wood flooring. That is because most 3/4" solid wood flooring has a wear layer of about .22" (just under 1/4") above the nail pocket groove. Virtu flooring has a wear layer of .17". The difference of .05" is a less than 1/16" difference.</p>
					<p style="padding:8px 0 16px 0">And because Virtu comes sanded to 100 grit, initial sanding is less. This is why the True Balanced Construction of Virtu maintains its flatness more reliably than other products, less material will be removed when sanding is required, which directly impacts lifecycle costs.</p>
